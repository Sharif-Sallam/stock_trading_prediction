# Project Description
Stock Trading Prediction Model
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts stock price movements based on historical data. By analyzing features such as daily returns, moving averages, volatility, and trading volume, the model provides insights into whether a stock's closing price will increase or decrease the next day.

The project is designed to serve as a practical exercise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The final model can help individuals explore the potential of machine learning in stock trading strategies.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and organize historical stock data for machine learning.
Feature Engineering: Generate features like daily returns, moving averages, and volatility to capture trends and patterns.
Model Training: Train a classification model (Random Forest) to predict price movements.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and feature importance visualizations.
Visualization: Plot feature importance to understand key drivers of predictions.
This project provides a hands-on approach for beginners and intermediate developers to learn the fundamentals of machine learning and its application to financial markets. It is structured to be modular, making it easy to extend and experiment with additional features, algorithms, or datasets.

# Prerequisites
1. Libraries:
Install the following Python libraries using pip or conda:
* pandas (for data manipulation)
* numpy (for numerical operations)
* scikit-learn (for machine learning)
* matplotlib (for data visualization)
Install them via:
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

2. Data Requirements:
Historical Stock Data:
A CSV file containing columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
If you do not have a dataset, you can download one from APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl.

# Installation Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
        Clone the repository from GitHub (if hosted online):

bash
git clone 

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
        Use your terminal or command prompt to navigate to the project folder:

bash
cd stock_trading_prediction

Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
        Create a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
    source venv/bin/activate

Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt:

bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 5: Prepare the Dataset
        Place your stock data CSV file (e.g., stock_data.csv) in the data/ folder.
        Ensure the CSV file has the following columns:
        Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.

Step 6: Verify the Installation
        Run the following command to check if the installation was successful:
bash
    python src/main.py

Note: If the setup is correct, the script will start processing the data, train the model, and display the evaluation results.

Step 7: Run Unit Tests (Optional)
        To verify the individual modules, run the tests:

bash
    pytest tests/

Step 8: (Optional) Customize the Project
        Modify the src/main.py file to adjust parameters like the test size, model type, or additional features.
        Add new data sources or experiment with other machine learning algorithms.

You are now ready to use the stock trading prediction model! For further usage instructions, refer to the Usage Guide section in the README.md.
